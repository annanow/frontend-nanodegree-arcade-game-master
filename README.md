Frontend Nanodegree Arcade Game
===============================

This game is part of the Udacity FEND project. The game comes with a ready-to-use engine and images and it implements the student's skills in Object Oriented JavaScript.


The player's goal is to avoid the beetles and help the boy reach the water side. If the boy collides with one of the beetles or when the player reaches the water unharmed, they start over from the bottom position.

Arrow keys are all you need to play this game.

Good luck!
